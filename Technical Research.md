# Ozed Network – Milestone 1: Technical Research (Decentralized Operating System)

## Preface: Evolution of the Ozed Vision
Ozed Network began as a **Layer 1 blockchain** focused on data sovereignty, transparency, and decentralized interoperability.  
As the research evolved, the architecture naturally expanded into a **Decentralized Operating System (dOS)** — a model that allows Ozed to host, govern, and interconnect decentralized applications while preserving individual and enterprise data rights.

This evolution does not alter Ozed’s original aim; it **enhances** it.  
Ozed Network now stands as a **sovereign digital ecosystem**, where blockchain infrastructure, data governance, and interoperable app environments converge to form a new paradigm of decentralized computing.

## Introduction
This document outlines the technical research and architectural design plan for **Milestone 1** of the **Ozed Network**.  
Ozed Network is envisioned not just as a blockchain, but as a **decentralized operating system (dOS)** that integrates blockchain infrastructure, data sovereignty protocols, and interoperable application environments.  
The goal of this milestone is to establish a **clear and scalable technical foundation** for development.

## A. Core Research Streams

### 1. Blockchain Foundation Layer (Base Chain) / Architectural Order
**Goal:** Establish Ozed’s Layer 1 blockchain using Substrate.

**Key Research Areas:**
- System topology overview
- Consensus model (BABE + GRANDPA or variant optimized for distributed data ops)
- Runtime pallets for data governance, identity, and native token (OZED)
- Chain storage and on-chain/off-chain communication logic
- Integration plan for Polkadot/Kusama interoperability (XCM or bridge)

---

### 2. Decentralized Operating System Layer
**Goal:** Research and define the framework that will allow Ozed Network to function like an operating system in a decentralized context.

**Key Research Areas:**
- **Kernel Logic:** Core resource management protocols — compute, memory, storage, and identity layers — secured by blockchain consensus  
- **Runtime Environment:** A modular environment for decentralized apps (dApps) to run directly on-chain or in hybrid off-chain containers  
- **API Layer:** Standard interfaces that allow existing Web2 apps (e.g., messaging, banking apps) to integrate into the Ozed OS  
- **Access & Control System:** Decentralized identity and permission model (DID + role-based governance)

---

### 3. Data Sovereignty & Interoperability Layer
**Goal:** Design the framework for sovereign data ownership, access, and interoperability.

**Key Research Areas:**
- Data governance protocols (ownership, usage rights, deletion rights)
- Cross-chain data interoperability schema (linked with the Polkadot ecosystem)
- Integration of decentralized storage systems like IPFS or Filecoin
- Encryption and access auditing mechanisms

---

### 4. Application & User Layer
**Goal:** Define how users and organizations will interact with Ozed OS.

**Key Research Areas:**
- Application containerization (sandboxing decentralized apps)
- Developer SDK and app store model (similar to iOS/Android, but decentralized)
- UI/UX model for OS interaction — decentralized desktop or dashboard environment
- Gateway nodes for non-blockchain applications (banking apps, messaging tools, etc.)

---

### 5. Governance & Economic Model
**Goal:** Establish governance and tokenomics aligned with sustainable network growth.

**Key Research Areas:**
- On-chain governance model (stakeholder voting, upgrade mechanisms)
- Token utility and economics (staking, data exchange fees, resource credits)
- Incentive structures for node operators and developers

## B. Deliverables

| Deliverable | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **1. Technical Architecture Document (v1)** | Unified blueprint covering blockchain, OS, data, and application layers |
| **2. Substrate Design Plan** | Detailed mapping of Ozed’s core pallets and consensus mechanisms |
| **3. dOS Architecture Map** | Diagram showing how the blockchain interacts with the OS kernel and data layers |
| **4. Data Sovereignty Framework** | Governance and interoperability model for user data |
| **5. SDK and API Concept Design** | Preliminary model for developer interaction and external app adoption |

---

## C. Recommended Tools

- **Languages:** Rust (core), TypeScript/Python (for SDK research)  
- **Frameworks:** Substrate, IPFS, WebAssembly, Docker, Polkadot JS API  
- **Documentation:** Markdown or Docusaurus for public architecture docs  
- **Design Tools:** Draw.io / Figma for system diagrams  

---

## D. Outcome of Milestone 1

1. A comprehensive system architecture for the Ozed decentralized OS  
2. A clear technical path from blockchain foundation → OS kernel → data → app integration  
3. A research-backed blueprint to inform prototype development (Milestone 2)
