# Ozed Network — Minimum Viable Chain (MVC) 
## Summary Document

## 🔰 Overview

The **Ozed Network Minimum Viable Chain (MVC)** represents the foundational phase of the Ozed Layer 1 blockchain — designed to prove the core concepts of **data sovereignty, decentralized storage, and transparent governance**. It establishes the technical and conceptual base for Ozed’s evolution into a full-scale **Data Sovereignty Infrastructure** for individuals, enterprises, and organizations.

## ⚙️ Core Components

### 1. **Substrate Runtime (Core Engine)**

Built on **Substrate**, the runtime defines the state transition logic of Ozed Network. It includes:

* **System Pallet:** Core blockchain primitives.
* **Ozed Kernel Interface (OKI):** The internal communication bus enabling pallet interoperability.
* **Data Pallet:** Manages data anchoring, CID proofs, and metadata.
* **Governance Pallet:** Manages council operations, referenda, and runtime upgrades.
* **Telemetry Pallet:** Tracks on-chain node health and performance metrics.

### 2. **Data Layer (IPFS Integration)**

Decentralized data storage and retrieval through **IPFS**, linking on-chain commitments to off-chain content. This ensures:

* Scalable storage architecture.
* Verifiable, immutable data records.
* Efficient resource usage by keeping large data off-chain.

### 3. **Chain Storage & Communication Logic**

Implements hybrid on-chain/off-chain storage:

* On-chain: metadata, CIDs, state proofs.
* Off-chain: file data, verification hashes, and telemetry streams.
* Uses RPC and REST APIs for seamless developer integration.

### 4. **Interoperability Layer (XCM & Bridge Architecture)**

Provides cross-chain messaging and data collaboration:

* **XCM:** For Substrate-native chains (Polkadot, Kusama, etc.)
* **Bridge Module:** For non-Substrate ecosystems (Ethereum, BSC, Cosmos).
* **Ozed Gateway SDK:** For developers to access and publish cross-chain data.

## 🧠 Development Expectations

* Deliver a **functional testnet** capable of registering, verifying, and storing decentralized data records.
* Demonstrate **on-chain governance** for protocol updates and system oversight.
* Validate **off-chain storage logic** via IPFS integration.
* Enable early **cross-chain communication** through XCM testing.

## 🌍 Use Cases

1. **Data Provenance & Auditing:**
   Organizations can register and verify data authenticity using CID proofs.
2. **Decentralized Content Registry:**
   Creators can anchor works (documents, media, research) immutably.
3. **Enterprise Compliance Tools:**
   Businesses can record tamper-proof compliance data.
4. **Research & Academic Verification:**
   Data-driven projects can reference verified, time-stamped research outputs.
5. **Governance Testing Ground:**
   Communities can pilot decentralized decision-making systems.

## 💡 Benefits

* **Transparency:** On-chain verification of all data commitments.
* **Sovereignty:** Individuals and organizations retain full control of their data.
* **Interoperability:** Designed for seamless cross-chain operations.
* **Scalability:** Hybrid architecture ensures performance and decentralization.
* **Security:** Cryptographic proofs ensure authenticity and data permanence.

## 🚀 Potentials Beyond MVC

1. **Ozed Data Market:** Incentivized decentralized storage economy.
2. **Cross-Chain Collaboration:** Shared data integrity between multiple ecosystems.
3. **Ozed dOS:** Evolution into a distributed operating system for decentralized computation.
4. **Edge & IoT Integration:** Data anchoring from telecom and IoT devices.
5. **DAO Governance:** Community-managed protocol evolution.

## 📈 After MVC — The Next Path

After completing the MVC phase, Ozed Network transitions into its next major milestones:

1. **Distributed Data & Storage Market (Phase 2):** Introduce token incentives and storage reputation systems.
2. **Cross-Chain Collaboration Layer (Phase 3):** Enable interoperability and shared data verification.
3. **Ozed dOS (Phase 4):** Expand the kernel for distributed computation.
4. **Edge/IoT Integration (Phase 5):** Extend Ozed to physical networks.
5. **DAO Governance (Phase 6):** Decentralized ecosystem management.

## 🧩 Strategic Vision

> Ozed Network’s MVC establishes the foundation for a **trustless, data-sovereign digital world**, where individuals and organizations can store, verify, and share data autonomously — forming the backbone of a new decentralized data economy.
