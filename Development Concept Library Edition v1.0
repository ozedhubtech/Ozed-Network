Alphabetically organized glossary of blockchain and Ozed Network-related terms.

A:
- API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of endpoints and methods allowing software applications to interact with blockchain nodes or smart contracts.

B:
- Block
A data structure containing a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block.
- Blockchain
A decentralized ledger that records transactions in blocks linked chronologically and secured by cryptography.

C:
- CLI (Command-Line Interface)
A text-based interface used to interact with blockchain nodes or development tools.
- Consensus Mechanism
The protocol through which all nodes in the network agree on the state of the blockchain.
- Cross-chain Collaboration
Ozed Networkâ€™s capacity to interact with other blockchain ecosystems such as Polkadot and Kusama.

D:
- Data Availability Layer
Ensures that all necessary data for verifying blocks is accessible to network participants.
- Data Provenance
The history and traceability of data from its creation to its usage.
- Data Sovereignty
The principle that individuals and organizations have full control over their data storage, access, and sharing.
- Decentralized Data Interoperability
The ability of blockchains and systems to exchange and verify data without central control.

G:
- Governance
The on-chain decision-making system that determines protocol upgrades and policies.
- Governance Token
A native token allowing holders to participate in protocol decision-making.

I:
- Immutability
Once data or transactions are recorded on the blockchain, they cannot be altered or deleted.
- Interoperability Protocols
Standards enabling secure communication and data exchange across different blockchains.
- IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
A decentralized storage network for sharing and accessing files distributed across nodes.

M:
- Modular Architecture
A blockchain design where components like consensus, execution, and storage are separated for flexibility.

N:
- Node
A computer that connects to the blockchain network, validating and sharing data with others.

O:
- On-chain Identity
A decentralized identity framework that links verifiable credentials to blockchain addresses.

P:
- Pallet
Modular components in Substrate defining specific functionalities such as balances, governance, and identity.
- Parachain
A blockchain connected to a relay chain in the Polkadot or Kusama network to share interoperability and security.
- Proof of Stake (PoS)
A consensus model where validators are chosen based on token staking rather than computational power.

R:
- Relay Chain
The central chain in Polkadot that coordinates and secures connected parachains.
- RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
A protocol that enables communication between a blockchain node and external applications.
- Runtime
Defines how transactions are processed and how the blockchain state transitions occur.

S:
- SDK (Software Development Kit)
A collection of tools, libraries, and documentation for building blockchain applications.
- Smart Contract
Self-executing code stored on the blockchain that runs automatically when predefined conditions are met.
- Substrate
A modular blockchain framework by Parity Technologies for building customizable blockchains.

T:
- Tokenomics
The economic model that governs token creation, distribution, and use within the ecosystem.
- Transparency
An immutable record of actions visible to all participants to ensure accountability and trust.

V:
- Validator
A participant that validates and produces new blocks, ensuring the network's integrity.

W:
- WASM (WebAssembly)
A binary instruction format used by Substrate runtimes for efficient execution across different environments.

X:
- XCMP (Cross-Chain Message Passing)
Protocol for communication between parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem.
