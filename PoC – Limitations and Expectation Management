This summary outlines the scope boundaries and limitations of the Ozed Network Proof of Concept (PoC). It helps manage expectations and clarify what is not included in the current development phase.

Scope Limitations
• The PoC will demonstrate core blockchain functionality — verifiable data registration, IPFS integration, and basic governance — but will not yet deliver a full mainnet or production-ready deployment.
• No tokenomics, staking, or financial components will be implemented at this stage; these are reserved for later ecosystem development.
• Privacy-focused cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs are not part of this initial build, as transparency and reproducibility are the current priorities.
• Enterprise integrations and user-facing applications will not be included in the PoC phase; the focus remains on blockchain and verification infrastructure.
• Governance will be minimal, showcasing a simple on-chain voting flow for demonstration purposes rather than a complex DAO structure.

Clarification of Expectations
The Ozed Network PoC is designed to validate technical feasibility, interoperability, and Substrate compatibility. It serves as a foundation for future development phases that will include network expansion, token models, enterprise adoption, and advanced privacy mechanisms.

Summary
This focused approach ensures the PoC remains achievable, auditable, and technically sound — setting a clear path for progressive development without overextending the project's initial scope.
